Approximately 1,711 DWs were filed between October 1 and December 31, 2020. By April 21, 2021 988 of those cases were closed. Figure 6 shows that the majority of cases in this time period resulted in non-suits. Only 22% of the cases we sampled from 2019 resulted in a non-suit judgment (Figure 2). Over 40% of closed cases resulted in repossession of property by the landlord. The majority of cases were decided in favor of the plaintiff by default or absence of the defendant in court. Only 4.7% of cases ended in dismissal. We have noted that since these data were collected, some landlords have returned to court to seek monetary damages after winning possession. Due to these additional judgments and illegal evictions occurring outside of the judicial process, we assume the rate of eviction and owing monetary damages following a DW is much higher than documented here.\"]]],[6,[[8,\"Of the 141 cases that noted both possession and financial damages, over $877,000 was awarded to plaintiffs or an average of $6,177.

Becase ZIP codes cross county lines, rates for some ZIP codes (i.e. 37027, 37135) are likely underestimated.

As a whole, there are higher rates of DWs issued in the eastern half of Davidson Co. in neighborhoods such as North Nashville, South Nashville, Antioch, Madison, and Donelson. Neighborhoods in the western half of Davidson Co. such as Belle Meade, Bellevue, and Joelton tended to have lower rates of DWs issued.

In recent months, numerous community groups have fought to hold landlords accountable for their abuses and disregard for renters across Nashville, including at Mosaic Apartments, WC Mobile Home Community, The Blue Note Apartments, and Porter East Apartments. To say this report will come at a crossroads in housing justice is an understatement. We must ask ourselves difficult questions: How many more families will be forced out of their homes? How many people who sustain Nashville will no longer be able to live here? How can we ensure development reflects the interests of our community?

These are desperate times that require collective action on a massive scale.\"]]],[6,[[8,\"The first step of rectifying these injustices is to expose them to the light.

In prior years (see Figure 1), between 700 and 1,300 DWs were issued every month. The number of DWs issued per month sharply declined to 122 cases in April 2020, but rebounded slightly in Summer 2020 (Figure 3). If the number of DWs issued in Davidson Co. continued to grow in the absence of COVID-19, we would have expected approximately 10% more DWs compared to 2020, or 12,650 issued per year and 1,054 per month in 2021.

Over 40% of closed cases resulted in repossession of property by the landlord. The majority of cases were decided in favor of the plaintiff by default or absence of the defendant in court. Only 4.7% of cases ended in dismissal. We have noted that since these data were collected, some landlords have returned to court to seek monetary damages after winning possession. Due to these additional judgments and illegal evictions occurring outside of the judicial process, we assume the rate of eviction and owing monetary damages following a DW is much higher than documented here.</div></div></div><div class="spacing-0-10 p-10 s p wf"><div class="spacing-5-5 s p wf"><div class="s t wc hc">Of the 141 cases that noted both possession and financial damages, over $877,000 was awarded to plaintiffs or an average of $6,177.
